(kdileep2, nidhinc2, nishtak2, shiming3) 

 

Communication: 

1. Team Meetings: We will meet once a week on Wednesdays from 7pm to 8:30pm using Zoom. We will all collaborate and take notes for every meeting on a google doc. 


2. Assistance: We’ll communicate through email or whatsapp. Every member must reply in less than 24 hours. 

3. Respect: The design of the project will be decided by simple majority. Each member will rotate being the designated project leader, taking a role of organizing the meeting, ensuring that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. Her/his role will also include architecting, documenting, and modifying the structure of the project’s code according to the discussion of the week; communicating with other members; and tracking their process of code implementation, decided during the meeting. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them. 

 
Collaboration: 


1. Work Distribution: Work will be split equally and make sure that there is no unbalanced workload between members. Every week the team decides on a set of deliverables and then distributes the work between the four members. Every member will be held accountable for their share of work and will be asked to explain their circumstances if by any chance they are unable to complete their share. 

 

2. Time Commitment: The group has decided to commit anywhere between three to six hours every week for this final project. The whole team takes responsibility to make sure every week’s deliverables are completed on their respective due dates.  

 

3. Conflict Resolution: We will try to resolve any conflict on the team with a majority vote. In the case of a tie, we will resolve the conflict with a rock, paper, scissors match between both teams.
